The **IoT Edge Dev Tool** greatly simplifies [Azure IoT Edge](https:/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/) development down to simple commands driven by environment variables.

 - It gets you started with IoT Edge development with the [IoT Edge Dev Container](quickstart) and IoT Edge solution scaffolding that contains a default module and all the required configuration files.
 - It speeds up your inner-loop dev (dev, debug, test) by reducing multi-step build & deploy processes into one-line CLI commands as well as drives your outer-loop CI/CD pipeline. _You can use all the same commands in both stages of your development life-cycle._

## Overview
For the absolute fastest way to get started with IoT Edge Dev, please see the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section below.

For a more detailed overview of IoT Edge Dev Tool including setup and commands, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev/wiki).

## Quickstart

> To set up development machines manually instead of using the IoT Edge Dev Container, please see the [Manual Development Machine Setup Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev/wiki/manual-dev-machine-setup).

This quickstart will run a container, create a solution, setup Azure resources, build and deploy modules to your device, setup and start the IoT Edge simulator, monitor messages flowing into IoT Hub, and finally deploy to the IoT Edge runtime.

<!-- Here's a 3 minute video walk-through of this Quickstart:

The only thing you need to install is Docker. All of the other dev dependencies are included in the container. 

1. **Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/)**

    - On Windows, only Linux containers are supported at this time. Windows container support is coming very soon! Please follow [the document](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives) to open Docker Settings and setup a Shared Drive.
    - For macOS, please follow [the document](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#file-sharing) to choose local directories to share with your containers.


1. **Run the IoT Edge Dev Container**

    Before you run the container, you will need to create a local folder to store your IoT Edge solution files.
    
    **Windows**
    ```
    mkdir c:\temp\iotedge
    docker run -ti -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v c:/temp/iotedge:/home/iotedge microsoft/iotedgedev
    ```

    **Linux**
    ```
    sudo mkdir /home/iotedge
    sudo docker run -ti -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /home/iotedge:/home/iotedge microsoft/iotedgedev
    ```

    **macOS**
    ```
    mkdir ~/iotedge
    docker run -ti -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/iotedge:/home/iotedge microsoft/iotedgedev
    ```

1. **Initialize IoT Edge solution and setup Azure resources**

    `iotedgedev init`

    > `iotedgedev init` will create a solution and setup your Azure IoT Hub in a single command. The solution comes with a default C# module named `filtermodule`.

    <summary>More information</summary>

    1. You will see structure of current folder like below:

    ```
        │  .env
        │  .gitignore
        │  deployment.template.json
        │
        ├─.vscode
        │      launch.json
        │
        └─modules
            └─filtermodule
                │  .gitignore
                │  Dockerfile.amd64
                │  Dockerfile.amd64.debug
                │  Dockerfile.arm32v7
                │  Dockerfile.windows-amd64
                │  filtermodule.csproj
                │  module.json
                │  Program.cs
    ```

    2. Open `.env` file, you will see the `IOTHUB_CONNECTION_STRING` and `DEVICE_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variables filled correctly.
    3. Open `deployment.template.json` file   
        1. You will see below section in the modules section:

        ```
        "filtermodule": {
            "version": "1.0",
            "type": "docker",
            "status": "running",
            "restartPolicy": "always",
            "settings": {
                "image": "${MODULES.filtermodule.amd64}",
                "createOptions": {}
            }
        }
        ```

        2. Two default routes are added:
        
        ```
        "routes": {
            "sensorTofiltermodule": "FROM /messages/modules/tempSensor/outputs/temperatureOutput INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/filtermodule/inputs/input1\")",
            "filtermoduleToIoTHub": "FROM /messages/modules/filtermodule/outputs/* INTO $upstream"
        }
        ```

    4. You will see privacy statement like below:

        ```
        Welcome to iotedgedev!
