# Azure IoT Edge Dev Tool

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/iotedgedev.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/iotedgedev)
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Azure-IoT-DDE-EdgeExperience/IoTEdgeDev/_apis/build/status/Azure.iotedgedev?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/Azure-IoT-DDE-EdgeExperience/IoTEdgeDev/_build/latest?definitionId=35&branchName=main)

The **IoT Edge Dev Tool** greatly simplifies [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/) development down to simple commands driven by environment variables.

- It gets you started with IoT Edge development with the [IoT Edge Dev Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iotedgedev/) and IoT Edge solution scaffolding that contains a default module and all the required configuration files.
- It speeds up your inner-loop dev (dev, debug, test) by reducing multi-step build & deploy processes into one-line CLI commands as well as drives your outer-loop CI/CD pipeline. _You can use all the same commands in both stages of your development life-cycle._

## Overview

For the absolute fastest way to get started with IoT Edge Dev, please see the [quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) section.

For a more detailed overview of IoT Edge Dev Tool including setup, commands and troubleshooting, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev/wiki).
