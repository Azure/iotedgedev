Welcome to the IoT Edge Dev Tool wiki!

The **IoT Edge Dev Tool** greatly simplifies [Azure IoT Edge](https:/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/) development down to simple commands driven by environment variables.

- It gets you started with IoT Edge development with the [IoT Edge Dev Container](quickstart) and IoT Edge solution scaffolding that contains a default module and all the required configuration files.
- It speeds up your inner-loop dev (dev, debug, test) by reducing multi-step build & deploy processes into one-line CLI commands as well as drives your outer-loop CI/CD pipeline. _You can use all the same commands in both stages of your development life-cycle._
